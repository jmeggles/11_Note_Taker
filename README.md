  ## Motivation
  Note Taker is to help keep us be organized and remember to do half the stuff we forget to do.  I tend to make lists for things that need to be done around the house...  "Fix this now, fix that later, replace this soon, get this at the store, look into that at some point", etc.  I can't remeber it all so the Note Taker is the best way to keep those lists, ideas (or chores) in one place to come back to for future reference.

  ## How_to_use
  This application can be used through Heroku https://note-taker-jme.herokuapp.com/) but can also be accessed by cloning this app from GitHub and using local host 5000 in your server and running node server,js in the terminal. 
  Begin application by clicking the Get Started button on the first page. Write a title for the note in the bold text line and the note test below it.  To save, click the save icon in the upper right corner (icon appears after note has been started).  To begin a new note click the pencil in the upper right corner.  To view notes, as they are saved they will appear in the left clumn and can be clicked on to view entire note, or to delete click the trash icon next to that note.  All notes will be saved until deleted even when you come back to the app after closing or refreshing!

  ## Benefit
  Anyone who needs to be more organized or is forgetful will benefit greatly from this Note Taker app but it works well for everyone!
